# Borderless Void – VS Code Theme
## Theme is created and aimed towards C++

A minimal, dark VSCode theme that aims to:
- Create a borderless editor experience
- Reduce "menu bloat"
- Encourage keybinding instead of navigating with a mouse

This is a **local VS Code theme extension**, not a Marketplace package.
